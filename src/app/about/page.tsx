            <p>
              I am a full stack developer with 5+ years of experience in startup
              with developing, deploying and maintaining services. I had mostly
              been in charge of web development, but also bring leadership
              experience in leading a team of engineers. I initially joined a
              small team as a machine learning researcher, but expanded my
              skillsets and responsibilities as the product and the team grew. I
              prioritizes features that bring business value and in order to
              bring meaningful business value, I tried to deliver features
              frequently and understand user&apos; behavior through data.

            <p>
              Lately, I had been very interested with LLM - of course, so is
              everyone else in the world - and its applications. I made the
              chatbot that answers questions about me, (please{" "}

                check it out
              </Link>{" "}
              if you hadn&apos;t already) and also small CLI tool

              the LLM model locally without using the server.

              {" "}
              I had also been looking into HTMX and Golang, I think it solves
              many problems and complexity that React is bringing to the web
              development and makes DX most pleasureable. I will be doing a
              small project soon.{" "}
