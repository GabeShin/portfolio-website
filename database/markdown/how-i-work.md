# How I approach work

When asked how I approach work, I often find myself discussing 'Flow,' a concept I initially encountered in college. For those in the know, 'Flow' is a state of deep focus that engages your entire skill set and makes time seem irrelevant. This idea has been pivotal for me; it's shaped how I think about work and even led me to become a software developer.

I start my day with 15 to 30 minutes of planning, which I believe to be the most crucial. This planning period serves dual purposes: it sets the day's objectives and allows me to break them into smaller, manageable tasks. By outlining what needs to be done and segmenting the work, I create a roadmap for the day that not only simplifies workload management but also paves the way for entering a state of 'Flow' more readily. Each segmented task then becomes a focus point, setting the stage for meaningful progress and sustained periods of deep focus.

To maintain a consistent 'Flow,' I also aim to keep my tasks slightly more challenging than my current skill level. In the ever-evolving field of development, there's always something new to learn. I often find myself searching for more effective methods to accomplish tasks, which not only adds a layer of challenge but also keeps the work interesting.

Being in 'Flow' is not just effective; it's also satisfying. Those moments of deep focus are something I look forward to and often lead to my most productive days. When the workday concludes, there's an innate sense of accomplishment, a satisfaction stemming from effectiveness and productivity.

In the software development arena, where tasks often demand deep focus—be it designing backend services or tackling frontend issues —'Flow' proved exceptionally useful to me.

In a nutshell, I try to keep 'Flow' as integral part of my work. Through a combination of planning and task segmentation, I set myself up for these periods of intense focus. The experience not only aids in accomplishing tasks but also brings a level of satisfaction and effectiveness that makes each workday rewarding for me.
