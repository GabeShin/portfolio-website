## Leading Seeso SDK team

In reflecting on my career journey, the two years I spent leading the SDK development team at Visualcamp stand out as a particularly transformative experience. The company was looking to pivot its existing product line, and the inception of a new team dedicated to building a gaze-tracking SDK was seen as a critical next step.

I had been vocal about my vision for what the SDK could achieve, and how we could build a winning team around it. This caught the attention of our CTO, who shared my enthusiasm and passion, and subsequently offered me the leadership role.

Taking the helm, I was aware of the enormous responsibility on my shoulders. One of the immediate challenges I faced was my own limited technical experience. Given the diverse set of operating systems we were targeting—Android, iOS, Windows, among others—the development was complex. I was tasked with not only overseeing technical development but also introducing agile methodology and fostering a healthy work culture.

The Agile approach was a cornerstone of how I envisioned the team dynamics. It required a transparent, open line of communication, something that proved to be a challenge given my own gaps in technical knowledge. Engaging every team member in meaningful discussion wasn't always straightforward. To overcome this, I often relied on more experienced developers to lead these intricate technical discussions. As time went on, I continually integrated Agile principles into the workflow while simultaneously broadening my own technical understanding.

The team's effort paid off. Our gaze-tracking SDK evolved to support over six different environments and now boasts more than 4 million unique monthly authentications from users worldwide. Thankfully, the quality and impact of our work didn't go unnoticed - we received several prestigious awards, including the [ the CES 2021 Innovation Awards](https://www.ces.tech/innovation-awards/honorees/2022/honorees/s/seeso.aspx) and the [2022 MWC GLOMO Awards for Best Mobile Innovation

Looking back, I see those years as a period of tremendous personal and professional growth. We had our share of obstacles, and I'm sure there were additional opportunities for improvement that we may not have seized. Yet, what the team achieved speaks for itself. Those challenging yet rewarding years have been an invaluable experience, shaping me into the person I am today and proud of the ground we broke as a team.
