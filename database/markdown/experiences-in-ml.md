My name is Gabe Shin, and I specialize in web development as a software engineer.

From a young age, I've always been a maker at heart. One saying that deeply resonates with me is, "The absence of limitation is the enemy of art." I firmly believe that true creativity emerges when you're working within constraintsâ€”it's the tools you have that shape your approach. I apply this philosophy to my work in software development.

I kicked off my professional journey at Visualcamp as a machine learning engineer during its early stage. The company was shifting focus to mobile gaze tracking technology, my primary role was to develop a gaze tracking model tailored for mobile devices.

### Academic Paper

In the early days of my stint at Visualcamp, my role was heavily focused on dissecting and understanding academic research. The field of machine learning was advancing at a staggering rate, and I found myself immersed in a plethora of research papers. This wasn't just about skimming through studies; it was about truly grasping the methodologies, theories, and results, then figuring out how to replicate them in our own context. This process was exhilarating and kept me on the frontier of a rapidly evolving landscape. From this experience, I honed my skills in critical analysis, understanding complex algorithms, and translating theoretical insights into actionable strategies.

### Data Collection

Data collection was another pillar of my work responsibilities, and the task was far from straightforward. To ensure a robust model, I collaborated with development team to develop a crowdsourcing app designed to pool high-quality data from the public. Navigating this aspect of the job demanded keen foresight, as we had to consider countless variables that could affect the model's performance. It became rapidly apparent that the quality and volume of data could have significant impact on our outcomes. Through this experience, I developed a nuanced understanding of data collection strategies, preprocessing techniques, and the importance of data quality in machine learning applications.

### Model Training

When it came to the actual model training, my role spanned from data preprocessing to designing the architectural framework, all the way to the training phase itself. Collaborating closely with the development team, we continually sourced and processed data, achieving a substantial 25% uptick in our model's accuracy. It represented a significant leap in the capabilities of our mobile gaze-tracking technology.

One of the standout aspects of this phase was the creative application of insights drawn from academic papers. I actively tried to integrate the understanding of the theories and methodologies into our existing model. Even more uniquely, I adapted methodologies commonly used in other fields to enhance our machine learning model. This cross-disciplinary approach pushed the boundaries of what our model could achieve. From this experience, I gained a rich array of skills that went beyond algorithmic proficiency. These include project management skills, a knack for ongoing optimization, and most importantly, a creative approach to problem-solving that enabled us to think outside the conventional boundaries of our field.
