# About Me

Hi. My name is Gabe Shin.

I am a web developer with background in the startup scene. From a young age, I've always been a maker at heart and the passion extends to this day. Now I love making a new software and exploring new possibilities with good company. The tedency to 'make' has been a core driver in my life, fueling my excitement when working on products and contemplating their impacts, which is a reason I like to be in the startup scene.

# This will be changed in the future

My academic journey took me to Washington University in St. Louis, where I majored in Business Strategy and Economics. Initially geared towards a career in business consulting, I made a pivot in my senior year, driven by a desire to create more tangible values. I was fortunate to secure a Research Assistant position with Professor Joseph Cullen, which became my gateway into coding.

Over the years, I've garnered skills in Python, Javascript, Node.js, and other backend technologies, alongside mastery in database management through SQL and NoSQL. I have an extensive background in cloud services, particularly AWS, and I incorporate Agile and Scrum methodologies into my development work. My DevOps capabilities include integrating complex systems while keeping user-centric design a priority.

I pride myself on my problem-solving abilities and have a strong knack for leading initiatives forward. My understanding of business and market dynamics has enabled me to contribute significantly to project management and customer interactions.

As for my career goals, I aim to continue creating products that bring value to the world. My long-term aspiration is to own a product, possibly even launching a small company. Currently, my interests are veering towards Large Language Models (LLM) and vector databases. More than the technology itself, I'm fascinated by the transformative impact machine learning is poised to have on the business landscape.

When I'm not engrossed in technology, I relish the time spent exercising. A former competitive rugby player through middle and high school, I still harbor a passion for sports. I make it a point to run or engage in resistance training at least 3 to 4 times a week and enjoy playing sports with friends whenever I can. Although I've always been a gamer at heart, finding the time for gaming has become increasingly challengingâ€”but it remains a cherished interest.

Currently, I'm based in Berlin, while working remotely for a company in Seoul, Korea.
