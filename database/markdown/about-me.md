## About Me

I am a experienced web developer with background in machine learning and AI.
I had managed development teams that created an machine learning based SDK which is used widely by users globally.

I am fueled by the passion to bring machine learning based products to the users.
I am an AI and machine learning enthusiast, with experienced in creating products utilizing computer visions, LLM, and text-to-image generations.
I considers myself a "forever student," eager to deepen and widen my knowledge of web development and stays in tunes with latest development in machine learning.
I am always looking for opportunities to bring my knowledge of web development and machine learning together.

I am currently working for a startup company as a senior web developer.
I believe personal empowerment and communication in the workplace is key to success - I like to engage with improving team's productivity outside the scope of the technical responsibilities.
